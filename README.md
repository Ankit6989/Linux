# Linux:
Linux is an open-source and Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the core component of various Linux distributions or "distros." It was initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since gained immense popularity worldwide. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility.

# Linux Kernel
![Screenshot from 2023-09-24 16-01-48](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/1c716de5-5ab7-4f83-bc62-9b01bb3e54fb)

- **Kernel:** The kernel is one of the core section of an operating system. It is responsible for each of the major actions of the Linux OS. This operating system contains distinct types of modules and cooperates with underlying hardware directly. The kernel facilitates required abstraction for hiding details of low-level hardware or application programs to the system. There are some of the important kernel types which are mentioned below:

1. **Monolithic Kernel:**
   - **Architecture:** In a monolithic kernel, the entire operating system, including device drivers, file systems, and system calls, resides in a single large binary image.
   - **Communication:** Components within the kernel can communicate with each other directly, as they share the same address space.
   - **Advantages:** Monolithic kernels are typically faster because there is minimal overhead in inter-component communication.
   - **Examples:** Linux and Unix are well-known examples of operating systems that use monolithic kernels, although modern Linux kernels can load and unload kernel modules for additional functionality.

2. **Microkernels:**
   - **Architecture:** Microkernels take a minimalist approach by moving most of the operating system's services, including device drivers and file systems, out of the kernel and into user-space processes.
   - **Communication:** Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms are used for components to communicate, making the system modular.
   - **Advantages:** Microkernels offer improved stability and security because individual components run in separate protected memory spaces. Faults in one component do not crash the entire system.
   - **Examples:** QNX and MINIX are examples of microkernel-based operating systems.

3. **Exokernels:**
   - **Architecture:** Exokernels take an extreme approach by providing very little abstraction over hardware resources. They expose hardware resources directly to applications.
   - **Communication:** Applications and libraries are responsible for managing hardware resources and communication.
   - **Advantages:** Exokernels offer high performance and flexibility, allowing applications to directly optimize resource usage. However, they require sophisticated programming skills.
   - **Examples:** Exokernels are more of a research concept and have limited practical implementations.

4. **Hybrid Kernels:**
   - **Architecture:** Hybrid kernels combine elements of both monolithic and microkernel architectures. They aim to strike a balance between performance and modularity.
   - **Communication:** Some components, such as device drivers, may run in kernel mode (like monolithic kernels), while others run in user mode (like microkernels).
   - **Advantages:** Hybrid kernels offer the flexibility of a microkernel with the performance benefits of a monolithic kernel for certain components.
   - **Examples:** Microsoft Windows NT and macOS are examples of operating systems that use hybrid kernels. They have a mix of user-mode and kernel-mode components.

### Working of Kernel:
The kernel is the core component of an operating system, including Linux. It acts as an intermediary between hardware and software, managing system resources, and providing essential services to applications and processes. Here's an overview of how the kernel works in a Linux system:

1. **Booting Process:**
   - When a computer is powered on or rebooted, the BIOS (or UEFI) initializes hardware components and loads the bootloader from a designated boot device.
   - The bootloader (commonly GRUB or LILO) loads the Linux kernel into memory from the file specified in its configuration.

2. **Kernel Initialization:**
   - Once loaded, the kernel begins initializing itself.
   - It performs hardware detection and configuration, identifies and initializes device drivers, and sets up essential data structures.

3. **User Space vs. Kernel Space:**
   - The kernel operates in a separate memory space called "kernel space" distinct from user applications' memory space called "user space."
   - This separation provides security and prevents user processes from directly accessing or modifying kernel data.

4. **System Calls:**
   - User applications communicate with the kernel through a set of predefined functions called system calls.
   - When an application requires a system service (e.g., file I/O, process management), it makes a system call, transitioning from user space to kernel space.

5. **Process and Memory Management:**
   - The kernel manages processes, creating, scheduling, and terminating them.
   - It allocates and deallocates memory for processes and handles memory protection to prevent processes from accessing unauthorized memory regions.

6. **File System and I/O Handling:**
   - The kernel manages file systems, providing access to files and directories.
   - It handles input and output (I/O) operations, including reading from and writing to devices, files, and network sockets.

7. **Device Drivers:**
   - Device drivers are modules within the kernel that interact with hardware devices.
   - The kernel loads appropriate device drivers during boot to support hardware components like disk drives, network cards, and graphics adapters.

8. **Interrupt Handling:**
   - The kernel responds to hardware interrupts generated by devices, such as keyboard input or network activity.
   - It switches context to handle interrupts, servicing the device's request, and resuming normal execution.

9. **Scheduling:**
   - The kernel employs a scheduler to manage the execution of multiple processes.
   - It allocates CPU time to processes based on priority, fairness, and scheduling policies.

10. **Security and Access Control:**
    - The kernel enforces security mechanisms like permissions, user and group access controls, and firewall rules.
    - It ensures that processes run with appropriate privileges and that unauthorized access is prevented.

11. **Error Handling:**
    - The kernel monitors system components for errors and failures.
    - It logs error messages and takes appropriate actions to recover from or mitigate issues when possible.

12. **Power Management:**
    - The kernel manages power-related tasks, such as controlling CPU frequency, putting hardware components into low-power states, and handling system sleep and wakeup.

13. **Network Stack:**
    - The kernel includes a network stack responsible for handling network communication, including routing, socket management, and data transmission.

14. **Modularity and Extensions:**
    - The Linux kernel is highly modular, allowing for the addition or removal of functionality through loadable kernel modules.
    - This modular approach helps keep the kernel core lean while supporting a wide range of hardware and features.

15. **System Calls Return:**
    - After servicing a system call or hardware interrupt, the kernel returns control to the user-space application, allowing it to continue executing.

# Linux File System Basics:

![Linux_compressed_page-0009](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/db1aa805-62ec-4190-bc6a-2d7218a8fdcc)

- All Linux filesystems are case-sensitive. This means that directory and file names that differ only in case are considered distinct.
- For example, /boot, /Boot, and /BOOT are three different directories.
- Many Linux distributions distinguish between core system utilities (essential for system operation) and other programs.
- Core utilities are typically located in directories directly under the system root directory, such as /bin and /sbin.
- Additional programs are often found under the /usr (user) directory. It's common to organize these programs further into subdirectories under /usr, like /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
- Understanding this organization can help you navigate and manage your Linux system effectively.

# Choosing a Linux Distribution:

# Questions to Ask When Choosing a Distribution:
### Some questions worth thinking about before deciding on a distribution include:

- What is the main function of the system (server or desktop)?
- What types of packages are important to the organization? For example, web server, word processing, etc.
- How much storage space is required, and how much is available? For example, when installing Linux on an embedded device, space is usually constrained.
- How often are packages updated?
- How long is the support cycle for each release? For example, LTS releases have long-term support.
- Do you need kernel customization from the vendor or a third party?
- What hardware are you running on? For example, it might be X86, RISC-V, ARM, PPC, etc.
- Do you need long-term stability? Or can you accept (or need) a more volatile cutting-edge system running the latest software versions?

# Linux Installation: Planning

- Deciding the partition layout is best done during the installation of Linux, as it can be challenging to change later.
- Linux systems manage multiple partitions by mounting them at specific points in the filesystem hierarchy.
- Most Linux distribution installers provide default partition layouts, often with one large partition for files and a smaller one for swap. This default layout suits many users.
- However, you can customize the partition layout during installation to meet your specific needs or if you have multiple disks to work with.
- Consider factors like separating the /home and /var directories onto separate partitions if you have special requirements or want to optimize disk usage.
- Getting the partition layout right during installation can simplify system management and prevent difficulties down the road.

# gnome-tweaks:

- Common system settings can often be accessed through the upper right-hand corner of the desktop, typically represented by a gear or similar icon.
- However, some settings may not be easily accessible through the default settings utility, especially in modern GNOME-based distributions.
- To access more advanced settings and customization options, you can use a tool called gnome-tweaks (formerly known as gnome-tweak-tool). This tool exposes additional settings and allows you to install external extensions.
- While gnome-tweaks may not be installed by default in some Linux distributions, you can typically launch it by pressing Alt-F2 and entering its name. You can also add it to your Favorites for easier access.
- Some recent distributions have divided the functionality of gnome-tweaks into a new tool called gnome-extensions-app.
- The screenshot provided shows an example of adjusting the keyboard mapping to repurpose the CapsLock key as an additional Ctrl key, which can be helpful for users who frequently use Ctrl commands, such as emacs users.
- Using tools like gnome-tweaks or gnome-extensions-app allows you to customize your Linux desktop and adapt it to your preferences and needs.

# Some Basic Utilities
There are some basic command line utilities that are used constantly, and it would be impossible to proceed further without using some of them in simple form before we discuss them in more detail. A short list has to include:
- cat: used to type out a file (or combine files).
- head: used to show the first few lines of a file.
- tail: used to show the last few lines of a file.
- man: used to view documentation.
The screenshot shows elementary uses of these programs. Note the use of the pipe symbol (|) used to have one program take as input the output of another.

# Turning Off the Graphical Desktop
Linux distributions can start and stop the graphical desktop in various ways. The exact method differs among distributions and between versions. For the newer system-based distributions, the display manager is run as a service, and you can stop the GUI desktop with the systemctl utility. In addition, most distributions will also work with the telinit command, as in:
```
$ sudo systemctl stop gdm (or sudo telinit 3)
```

and restart it (after logging into the console) with:

```
$ sudo systemctl start gdm (or sudo telinit 5)
```
![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/1db07dcc-86f3-41a5-bc54-2b154a2384a9)

# Basic Operations

## Logging In and Out:

- To log into a text terminal, you'll be prompted for a username (usually with the string "login:") and a password. When typing your password, no characters are displayed on the screen to keep it secure.
- After successfully logging in, you can perform basic operations and commands within your session.
- You can also connect to and log into remote systems using Secure SHell (SSH). For example, the command ssh student@remote-server.com connects securely to the remote server "remote-server.com." You can log in using either 
  a password or a cryptographic key for secure authentication.
- SSH is a powerful tool for remote access and secure communication in Linux systems.
![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/415dea24-aa60-445d-8398-95cf74454594)

## Rebooting and Shutting Down:

- The preferred method to shut down or reboot the system is to use the shutdown command. This sends a warning message, and then prevents further users from logging in. The init process will then control shutting down or 
  rebooting the system. It is important to always shut down properly; failure to do so can result in damage to the system and/or loss of data.
- The halt and poweroff commands issue shutdown -h to halt the system; reboot issues shutdown -r and causes the machine to reboot instead of just shutting down. Both rebooting and shutting down from the command line     
  requires superuser (root) access.
- When administering a multi-user system, you have the option of notifying all users prior to shutdown, as in:
```
$ sudo shutdown -h 10:00 "Shutting down for scheduled maintenance."
```

## Locating Applications:

- One way to locate programs is to employ the which utility. For example, to find out exactly where the diff program resides on the filesystem:
```
$ which diff
/usr/bin/diff
```

- If which does not find the program, whereis is a good alternative because it looks for packages in a broader range of system directories:
```
$ whereis diff
diff: /usr/bin/diff /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1p/diff.1p.gz
```
as well as locating source and man files packaged with the program.

## Accessing Directories:
- When you first log into a system or open a terminal, the default directory should be your home directory. You can see the exact location by typing echo $HOME. However, most Linux distributions open new graphical terminals in $HOME/Desktop instead.
![Screenshot from 2023-09-09 12-22-08](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/978e69a3-e205-415f-bbd9-42171afb4219)

## Understanding Absolute and Relative Paths:

- **Absolute Pathname**: It begins with the root directory (/) and follows the directory tree from the root to the desired directory or file. Absolute paths always start with /.

- **Relative Pathname**: It starts from the present working directory and doesn't begin with /. Relative paths are shorter and don't specify the full path from the root.

- Multiple slashes (//) between directories and files are allowed, but extra slashes between elements are ignored by the system.

- Common shortcuts include:
  - `.` (dot): Represents the present directory.
  - `..` (dot dot): Represents the parent directory.
  - `~` (tilde): Represents your home directory.

For example, if you're in your home directory and want to move to /usr/bin:
- Absolute Pathname Method: `$ cd /usr/bin`
- Relative Pathname Method: `$ cd ../../usr/bin`

In this case, the absolute pathname method is shorter and less error-prone.

![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/336fc508-ded4-40e6-aab4-f032a1d28592)

## Exploring the Filesystem:
- Traversing up and down the filesystem tree can get tedious. The tree command is a good way to get a bird’s-eye view of the filesystem tree. Use ```tree -d``` to view just the directories and to suppress listing file names.

# HardLinks

#### Scenario: 
- You have a file named file1. You want to create another file named file2 that is essentially the same as file1, but you want them to share the same data blocks on your disk.
- The touch command is used to create a new, empty file with the specified name or update the access and modification times of an existing file.

#### Creating Hard Links:
1) First, you create "file1" with some content:
```
$ echo "This is file1." > file1
```
2) Now, you create a hard link called file2 that points to the same data as file1:
```
$ ln file1 file2
```
3) At this point, if you list the files using ls, they both appear as separate files.
4) The "-i" option to ls prints out in the first column the inode number, which is a unique quantity for each file object.
```
$ ls -li file1 file2
```
The output will show that both file1 and file2 share the same inode number, indicating they are linked to the same data. However, it might seem like you have two files with different names.

![Screenshot from 2023-09-13 00-19-47](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/7c4c8c89-4d4c-421b-958b-98db2825eab5)

#### How Hard Links Work:
- Hard links essentially share the same data blocks on your disk. When you create a hard link, you're creating a new filename (file2 in this case) that points to the same data blocks as the original file (file1). The inode number, which is a unique identifier for the data blocks, is the same for both file1 and file2.

#### Caution with Hard Links:
- Removing either file1 or file2 won't delete the data blocks they share. It will only remove the link. If you recreate a file with the same name, it might use the same data blocks, leading to unexpected behavior.
- Editing one of the linked files should generally retain the link, but depending on your text editor, some actions might break the link, resulting in separate data blocks.

#### Summary:

Hard links allow you to create multiple filenames that share the same data blocks on your disk, saving space. However, be cautious when deleting or editing linked files, as it can affect how the links work and the underlying data.

# Soft(Symbolic)Links
- Imagine you have a folder on your computer called "Documents," and inside it, there's a file named "Report.docx." You want to create a shortcut to this file on your desktop because you frequently access it.

### 1)Creating a Soft Link:
You open your terminal and navigate to your desktop. Then, you run the following command:
```
ln -s ~/Documents/Report.docx ReportShortcut.docx
```
![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/9bfd2c94-41f1-4866-a0fd-dafd56896915)

![Screenshot from 2023-09-14 20-22-11](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/5fd776e2-f0e1-4b63-9da7-69f51dd6401c)
![Screenshot from 2023-09-14 20-22-52](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/e44ca42d-290f-4cc4-a643-846423f470c9)


- ln is the command for creating links.
- -s specifies that you want to create a symbolic (soft) link.
- ~/Documents/Report.docx is the path to the original file you want to link to.
- ReportShortcut.docx is the name you want to give to your shortcut.

### 2)Understanding the Result:
Now, on your desktop, you have a file named "ReportShortcut.docx." To you, it looks like a regular file, but it's actually a symbolic link to the original "Report.docx" file in your "Documents" folder.

### 3)Flexibility:
The beauty of symbolic links is that they are like shortcuts. If you decide to move "Report.docx" to another folder or rename it, your "ReportShortcut.docx" link will still work. It always points to the original file's current location and name.

### 4)Cross-Filesystem Links:
Symbolic links can even point to files on different drives or network locations. For instance, you can create a link on your desktop that points to a file on an external hard drive.

### 5)Dangling Links:
Be cautious, though. If you create a symbolic link to a file, and then you delete or move the original file, you'll have what's called a "dangling link." Your link will still exist, but it won't point to anything valid. So, always ensure your links are up to date.

In summary, symbolic links are like shortcuts that can point to files or folders anywhere on your computer or even on different devices. They offer flexibility and make it easy to access frequently used items, even if their locations change.

# Navigating the Directory History:
The **'cd'** command in Linux and Unix-like operating systems allows you to change your current working directory. Here's how it works:
![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/32ded9a3-c41d-439f-a2e2-cbc80ec79685)


**cd [directory]**: This command is used to change your current directory to the specified **[directory]**. For example:
```
cd /home/user/documents
```
![Screenshot from 2023-09-14 20-46-23](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/7c56fcf7-f1a9-468b-ae11-328b5995fd92)

This changes the current directory to "/home/user/documents."

**cd ..**: The double-dot (..) is a special notation that allows you to move up one directory level. For example:
```
cd ..
```
![Screenshot from 2023-09-14 20-46-40](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/b9b61c5a-38b2-4c22-af54-4c1a32a8b0b3)

This would move you up one level in the directory structure.

**cd without an argument**: If you simply type cd without specifying a directory, it will take you back to your home directory. For example:

```
cd
```
![Screenshot from 2023-09-14 20-47-07](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/179b9cde-f867-4eda-bd6f-86981d72f538)

This would take you to your home directory, such as "/home/user" or "~" (a shorthand for the home directory).

**cd -**: The hyphen (-) is used to switch between the current directory and the previous directory you were in. For example:
```
cd -
```
![Screenshot from 2023-09-14 20-48-02](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/03aca9b3-dfac-47eb-a166-751065b1991a)

This toggles between your current directory and the previous one.

The **pushd**, **popd**, and **dirs** commands are related to directory manipulation:

**pushd [directory]**: This command pushes the current directory onto a stack and changes the current directory to the specified [directory]. It's useful for temporarily changing directories while keeping a record of where you were.

**popd**: This command pops the most recent directory from the stack and changes the current directory back to it. This is helpful for returning to previously visited directories in reverse order.

**dirs**: The **'dirs'** command displays the list of directories currently stored in the directory stack.

These commands are especially useful when you need to navigate between multiple directories quickly or switch back and forth between two directories.

**"pwd"** : **prints the full name (the full path) of current/working directory.** By default, right after ssh-ing to a Linux machine you would find yourself in your home directory, usually /home/<username>.

# Working with Files:
Linux provides many commands that help you with viewing the contents of a file, creating a new file or an empty file, changing the timestamp of a file, and moving, removing and renaming a file or directory. These commands help you in managing your data and files and in ensuring that the correct data is available at the correct location.

## Viewing Files:

## touch
- touch is often used to set or update the access, change, and modify times of files. By default, it resets a file's timestamp to match the current time.

-However, you can also create an empty file using touch:
```
$ touch <filename>
```

- This is normally done to create an empty file as a placeholder for a later purpose.

- touch provides several useful options. For example, the -t option allows you to set the date and timestamp of the file to a specific value, as in:
```
$ touch -t 12091600 myfile
```

This sets the myfile file's timestamp to 4 p.m., December 9th (12 09 1600).

## mkdir and rmdir:
- The mkdir command is a fundamental tool in the Linux command-line for creating directories. It's straightforward to use, as demonstrated in your examples. Here's a brief summary:

- **'mkdir sampdir'**: Creates a directory named "sampdir" in the current directory.
- **'mkdir /usr/sampdir'**: Creates a directory named "sampdir" under the "/usr" directory.
However, it's crucial to use the **'rmdir'** and **'rm -rf'** commands carefully, as they deal with directory removal:

- **'rmdir directory_name'**: Removes an empty directory. If the directory isn't empty, it will not work.
- **'rm -rf directory_name'**: Deletes a directory and all its contents forcefully. Be cautious when using this command, as it can't be undone, and data will be permanently lost.
  
- Always double-check your paths and the contents of the directories you're about to remove to avoid accidental data loss.


## Moving, Renaming or Removing a File:

1. `mv` Command:
   - `mv` stands for "move."
   - It has two primary functions:
     - **Rename a File:** You can use the `mv` command to simply rename a file. For example, `mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt` will rename `oldfile.txt` to `newfile.txt` in the same directory.
     - **Move a File:** You can also use `mv` to move a file to another location. This can include changing its name if you specify a different destination path. For example, `mv file.txt /path/to/destination/` will move `file.txt` to the specified destination path and retain its original name. To change the name during the move, you can specify a different name in the destination path, like `mv file.txt /path/to/destination/newname.txt`.

2. `rm` Command:
   - `rm` stands for "remove."
   - When used without any options, it deletes files or directories without asking for confirmation. For example, `rm file.txt` will delete `file.txt` without any confirmation prompt.
   - To remove files interactively, you can use the `-i` option with `rm`. This prompts you before each removal, ensuring you don't accidentally delete files. For example, `rm -i file.txt` will ask for confirmation before deleting `file.txt`.

These commands are essential tools for managing files and directories in a Unix/Linux environment, and understanding their usage is crucial for efficient file management.

![Screenshot from 2023-09-25 19-33-28](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/bbfa49e5-1b31-4194-8a70-4b050fdadb95) 

3. `rmdir` Command:
   - `rmdir` is used to remove directories, but it has a limitation—it can only remove empty directories.
   - **If you attempt to use `rmdir` on a directory that contains files or other subdirectories, you will receive an error message, and the directory will not be removed.**
   - It's a safe way to delete directories when you're certain they are empty.

4. `rm -rf` Command:
   - `rm -rf` is a command used for recursively and forcefully removing directories and their contents.
   - `rm` stands for "remove," and `-r` stands for "recursive," which means it will remove not only the specified directory but also all files and subdirectories within it, and any subdirectories within those subdirectories, and so on, until everything is deleted.
   - `-f` stands for "force," which means it won't ask for confirmation before removing files or directories. This can be dangerous because it allows for the deletion of files and directories without any confirmation prompts.

   **Important Note**: 
   - Using `rm -rf` should be done with extreme caution, especially when using it with administrative privileges (e.g., as the root user). A small mistake or incorrect path can result in the deletion of important data, system files, or directories.
   - It's often recommended to use this command only when you are absolutely sure about what you are deleting, and it's advisable to double-check the paths and contents before executing it.

![Screenshot from 2023-09-25 20-03-47](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/88c292c6-e05b-4e45-9f69-0608aa46d9a1)


## Modifying the Command Line Prompt

- `PS1` is an environment variable that defines the format of the command prompt displayed in the terminal.

- The default value of `PS1` is typically set by the system or distribution to provide a basic and informative prompt. For example, it might show the current working directory or the username.

- However, users can customize their command prompt by changing the value of the `PS1` variable. This customization allows users to display various information elements in the prompt, such as the username (`\u`), the hostname (`\h`), the current working directory (`\w`), and more.

- In your example, the command `PS1="\u@\h \$ "` sets the `PS1` variable to display the username (`\u`), the hostname (`\h`), and a `$` symbol followed by a space as the prompt.

- When you enter this command, the prompt immediately changes to reflect the new format. For example, it becomes `student@r9 $`.

- You can use various escape sequences like `\u` and `\h` to insert dynamic information into your prompt. For instance, `\u` displays the username, and `\h` displays the hostname.

- By convention, the root user often has a different prompt to make it clear that you are operating with elevated privileges. The pound sign (`#`) is commonly used as the root prompt, making it easy to distinguish from a regular user prompt.

Customizing the `PS1` variable can be helpful, especially when working on multiple systems or in different roles, as it provides a visual reminder of who you are and what machine you are using. Users can set their preferred `PS1` value in their shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc` for Bash) to make the change permanent across sessions.

## Searching for Files: 

### Standard File Streams:

- There are three standard file streams (or descriptors) that are always open when commands are executed in Unix/Linux:
   - Standard Input (stdin), often represented as 0, is typically associated with keyboard input.
   - Standard Output (stdout), often represented as 1, is used for normal command output, which is displayed on the terminal by default.
   - Standard Error (stderr), often represented as 2, is used for error messages and warnings, which are also displayed on the terminal by default.
![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/1ef80a77-bfb0-4776-88d7-aaa43d58213c)


- By default, stdin is connected to the keyboard, and stdout and stderr are printed on the terminal.

- stderr is commonly redirected to an error logging file to capture error messages separately.

- stdin can be redirected to come from a file or the output of a previous command through a pipe.

- stdout is often redirected into a file to save command output to a file.

- File descriptors are used to represent open files internally in Linux. They are represented by numbers starting at zero.

- stdin corresponds to file descriptor 0, stdout corresponds to file descriptor 1, and stderr corresponds to file descriptor 2.

- If additional files are opened in addition to these three defaults, they will be assigned file descriptors starting from 3 and increasing as needed.

- In various examples and situations, commands can be configured to alter where they get their input, where they write their output, or where they print diagnostic (error) messages by manipulating these standard file streams and file descriptors.

### I/O Redirection: 

- In the command shell, you can redirect the three standard file streams to change the source of input and where output and error messages are written.

- To change the input source from the keyboard to a file, use the less-than sign `<` followed by the name of the file:

  ```
  $ do_something < input-file
  ```
  ![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/d56d887b-d254-4225-ada3-fa851bc2cd1b)

- To redirect the output of a command to a file, use the greater-than sign `>`:

  ```
  $ do_something > output-file
  ```

- You can both change the input source and redirect the output at the same time:

  ```
  $ do_something < input-file > output-file
  ```
  ![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/ec680ec7-9509-4b01-8c8a-2123e0a4ceb3)

- By default, error messages (stderr) are still displayed on the terminal.

- To redirect stderr to a separate file, use stderr's file descriptor number (2) followed by the greater-than sign `>` and the name of the error file:

  ```
  $ do_something 2> error-file
  ```
  ![Screenshot from 2023-09-27 13-19-16](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/cfc64799-ae2d-4dd0-89fa-7f44758d6e85)
  ![Screenshot from 2023-09-27 16-11-44](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/2ffb5856-8674-410f-9a57-294bfb19e6df)
  ![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/02ecbc9f-ebe5-48de-96e8-fd885fda4dbc)




- Note that `do_something 1> output-file` is the same as `do_something > output-file`, as 1 is the default file descriptor for stdout.

- You can redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file using the `2>&1` notation:

  ```
  $ do_something > all-output-file 2>&1
  ```

- In Bash, you can use a shorthand notation to achieve the same redirection:

  ```
  $ do_something >& all-output-file
  ```

These redirection techniques are useful for managing input and output in Unix/Linux commands and scripts, allowing you to work with files and control where data is sent.

**Video:** ```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPKIMmbe9I```

### Pipes:

- **UNIX/Linux Philosophy:** The UNIX/Linux philosophy emphasizes the use of many simple and short programs (commands) that work together to accomplish complex tasks. This approach favors simplicity and modularity over creating one complex program with numerous options and modes of operation.

- **Pipes (|):** To facilitate the cooperation of commands, UNIX/Linux systems utilize pipes, represented by the vertical-bar symbol (`|`). Pipes allow you to pass the output of one command as input to another command in a chain, creating a pipeline of commands.

- **Pipeline Example:** You can create a pipeline of commands by chaining them together using pipes. For example:
  
  ```
  $ command1 | command2 | command3
  ```
  ![Screenshot from 2023-09-27 16-27-52](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/97403cba-3322-449f-9ecc-49c5eb10d8f4)


  In this pipeline, the output of `command1` serves as the input for `command2`, and the output of `command2` serves as the input for `command3`.

- **Efficiency:** Pipelining commands is highly efficient. Commands in the pipeline do not need to wait for the entire pipeline to complete before processing data. On systems with multiple CPUs or cores, available computing power is effectively utilized, resulting in faster execution.

- **No Need for Temporary Files:** One advantage of using pipelines is that there's no need to save intermediate output in temporary files between stages. This saves disk space and reduces disk I/O operations, which can be a significant performance bottleneck.

- **Reduces Bottlenecks:** Disk I/O, often the slowest operation in computing, is minimized when using pipelines. Since data is transferred directly from one command to the next in memory, it speeds up the overall process.

In summary, the UNIX/Linux philosophy of using simple, modular commands and pipelines promotes efficiency, flexibility, and the ability to perform complex operations by combining the strengths of individual commands, all while minimizing the need for temporary storage and disk I/O.


## Searching for Files: 

- Being able to quickly find the files you are looking for will save you time and enhance productivity. You can search for files in both your home directory space, or in any other directory or location on the system.

- The main tools for doing this are the locate and find utilities. We will also show how to use wildcards in bash, in order to specify any file which matches a given generalized request.

### locate & find program:

- ``find`` is an extremely useful and often-used utility program in the daily life of a Linux system administrator. It recurses down the filesystem tree from any particular directory (or set of directories) and locates files that match specified conditions. The default pathname is always the present working directory.

- For example, administrators sometimes scan for potentially large core files (which contain diagnostic information after a program fails) that are more than several weeks old in order to remove them.

- The `locate` utility in Linux, which is used for searching files and directories in a database, and how it can be combined with `grep` to filter and narrow down search results. Here's a summary of the key points:

- **`locate` Utility:** The `locate` command is used to perform file and directory searches based on a previously constructed database of files and directories on the system. It's a fast and efficient way to find files matching a specified character string.

- **Database Usage:** `locate` uses a pre-built database of file and directory names, which makes it faster than searching the entire filesystem. The database is usually updated automatically by a related utility called `updatedb`.

- **Filtering with `grep`:** ***To refine the results obtained from `locate`, you can use `grep` as a filter. `grep` is a command-line utility that searches for specified text patterns in input and prints the lines that contain those patterns.***

- **Example Usage:** You can combine `locate` and `grep` with a pipe (`|`) to filter `locate` results. For example:
  
  ```
  $ locate zip | grep bin
  ```

  This command will list all files and directories where both "zip" and "bin" appear in their names.

- **Database Update:** The database used by `locate` is updated by the `updatedb` utility. This update process typically runs automatically once a day on most Linux systems. However, you can manually update the database at any time by running `updatedb` from the command line as the root user.

In summary, `locate` is a powerful tool for quickly searching files and directories based on a database, and when combined with `grep`, it allows you to filter and refine your search results to find exactly what you're looking for. The database used by `locate` is regularly updated by `updatedb` to ensure up-to-date search results.

### WildCards and Matching File Names:

![Screenshot from 2023-09-28 09-48-37](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/504fe643-794c-43b3-854e-176db18cba78)

- **`?` Wildcard:** The `?` wildcard matches any single character. It's useful when you want to search for files where you know some characters but not others. For example:
  
  ```
  ls ba?.out
  ```

  This command lists files with names starting with "ba," followed by any single character, and ending with ".out."
  ![Screenshot from 2023-09-28 09-58-20](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/1ba4b5e6-37fa-4b3f-9b8c-5dacde5bea8f)

- **`*` Wildcard:** The `*` wildcard matches any string of characters (including none). It's used when you want to search for files where you know part of the name but not the entire name. For example:

  ```
  ls *.out
  ```

  This command lists all files with names ending in ".out," regardless of the characters before the ".out" extension.

- **`[set]` Wildcard:** The `[set]` wildcard allows you to match any character within a specified set of characters. For example:

  This command lists files with names that contain a single character, and that character can be either 'a,' 'd,' or 'f,' followed by ".txt."

- **`[!set]` Wildcard:** The `[!set]` wildcard matches any character that is not in the specified set of characters. For example:

  ```
  ls [!aeiou].doc
  ```

  This command lists files with names that contain a single character not among the vowels ('a,' 'e,' 'i,' 'o,' 'u'), followed by ".doc."

Wildcards are powerful tools for searching and manipulating files and directories in the command line, allowing you to locate and work with files based on flexible naming patterns.

### Using Advanced find Options: 
!!!

### Finding Files Based on Time and Size:

**Finding Files Based on Time:**

- You can use the `-ctime`, `-atime`, and `-mtime` options with `find` to search for files based on their inode metadata change time, access time, or modification time, respectively.
- Here, `-ctime` is when the inode metadata (i.e. file ownership, permissions, etc.) last changed; it is often, but not necessarily, when the file was first created. You can also search for accessed/last read `(-atime)` or modified/last written `(-mtime)` times. The number is the number of days and can be expressed as either a number `(n)` that means exactly that value, `+n`, which means greater than that number, or `-n`, which means less than that number. There are similar options for times in minutes (as in `-cmin`, `-amin`, and `-mmin`).
- The number after these options represents the number of days ago when the event occurred, and you can use `+n` to search for files older than n days or `-n` to search for files newer than n days.

Example: To find files with inode metadata changed exactly 3 days ago:

```bash
$ find / -ctime 3
```

**Finding Files Based on Size:**

```bash
$ find / -size 0
```
- You can use the `-size` option with `find` to search for files based on their size. The size is measured in 512-byte blocks by default, but you can specify other units like bytes (c), kilobytes (k), megabytes (M), or gigabytes (G).
- To search for files larger or smaller than a specific size, you can use `+n` or `-n`, respectively.

Example: To find files larger than 10 megabytes and run a command on them:

```bash
$ find / -size +10M -exec command {} ';'
```

In this example, replace `command` with the actual command you want to run on the files that match the size criterion.

These `find` options are helpful for searching and performing actions on files based on various attributes, providing flexibility in managing files in your Unix/Linux system.

## Installing Software:

### Package Management Systems on Linux:
It is emphasizing on the two major families: those based on Debian (such as APT) and those using RPM (such as YUM and DNF). These package managers play a crucial role in installing, removing, and managing software packages in Linux distributions. Here's a summary of the key points:

- **Package Management:** Package management systems in Linux are responsible for installing, updating, and removing software packages on a system. These packages contain files and instructions needed to ensure that a software component works well within the Linux ecosystem.

- **Dependencies:** Packages can have dependencies, meaning they rely on other packages to function correctly. For instance, a Python-based application package may require specific Python packages to be installed.

- **Debian and RPM Families:** There are two primary families of package managers:
  - **Debian Family:** This includes package managers like APT (Advanced Package Tool) used in Debian and Ubuntu-based distributions. APT uses `.deb` packages.
  - **RPM Family:** This includes package managers like YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) and DNF (Dandified YUM) used in Red Hat-based distributions. RPM package management uses `.rpm` packages.

- **Essential Features:** Both families provide essential package management features, including installing, updating, and removing packages. They also handle dependencies and ensure software components work well together.

- **Specialized Distributions:** Some specialized Linux distributions may use alternative package management systems tailored to their specific needs.

- **Command Line:** Package management is often done via the command line using specific package manager commands. Examples include:
  - `apt-get` and `apt` (Debian family)
  - `yum` and `dnf` (RPM family)

These package management systems are a core part of Linux distributions, making it easy to manage software components, keep systems up to date, and ensure compatibility between various software packages. Understanding how to use the appropriate package manager commands is essential for Linux system administrators and users.

### Package Managers: Two Levels:

- **Low-Level Tool:** The low-level tool, such as `dpkg` (Debian Package) or `rpm` (Red Hat Package Manager), handles the technical details of managing individual packages. This includes tasks like unpacking packages, running installation scripts, and ensuring that the software is correctly installed on the system.

- **High-Level Tool:** The high-level tool, such as `apt`, `dnf`, or `zypper`, works with groups of packages and provides a more user-friendly interface for managing software. It interacts with the low-level tool as needed to perform tasks like downloading packages from repositories and resolving package dependencies.

- **Dependency Resolution:** One of the critical functions of the high-level tool is dependency resolution. It automatically identifies and installs all the required dependencies for a package. This ensures that the software works correctly and that all necessary libraries and components are in place.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Most users interact primarily with the high-level package management tool, which simplifies the process of installing, updating, and removing software. Users can request actions like installing a package, and the high-level tool takes care of the underlying complexities.

- **Complexity Warning:** While high-level package managers provide convenience, it's essential to be cautious when installing packages, as a single package may have numerous dependencies. Installing one package could trigger the installation of many additional packages to satisfy dependencies. This is why it's important to review the list of packages to be installed before proceeding.

Overall, the combination of low-level and high-level package management tools in Linux distributions makes it easier for users to manage software packages while ensuring that dependencies are correctly handled. This approach simplifies the installation and maintenance of software on Linux systems.

### Working With Different Package Management Systems: 

Given information is about three popular package management systems used in different Linux distributions: `apt` for Debian-based systems, `dnf` for Red Hat family systems, and `zypper` for SUSE/openSUSE. Here's a brief summary of each:

- **APT (Advanced Packaging Tool):**
  - **Usage:** APT is the package management system used in Debian-based Linux distributions, including Debian itself and Ubuntu.
  - **Interface:** It provides both command-line tools (e.g., `apt` and `apt-get`) and graphical interfaces (e.g., Ubuntu Software Center and Synaptic).
  - **Functionality:** APT is known for its robust dependency resolution and package management capabilities. It can install, upgrade, and remove software packages and repositories.
  - **Common Commands:** Examples of APT commands include `apt-get install`, `apt-get update`, and `apt-cache search`.

- **DNF:**
  - **Usage:** DNF is the package management utility for RPM-compatible Linux systems within the Red Hat family, such as Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL.
  - **Interface:** DNF primarily operates from the command line.
  - **Functionality:** DNF is designed to handle package management tasks like installing, updating, and removing packages. It also handles dependency resolution.
  - **Common Commands:** Typical DNF commands include `dnf install`, `dnf update`, and `dnf remove`.

- **Zypper:**
  - **Usage:** Zypper is the package management system used in the SUSE/openSUSE family of Linux distributions.
  - **Interface:** Zypper is primarily a command-line tool, and it also allows you to manage repositories from the command line.
  - **Functionality:** Zypper is known for its straightforward and efficient package management capabilities. It can be used to install, update, and remove packages, as well as manage repositories.
  - **Common Commands:** Some commonly used Zypper commands are `zypper install`, `zypper update`, and `zypper remove`.

Each of these package management systems serves the specific needs of its respective Linux distributions and provides tools for installing, updating, and managing software packages. While the commands and specific features may differ, the core functionality of package management remains consistent across these systems.

# Finding Linux Documentation:

### Linux Documentation Sources:

- Linux-based systems provide various sources of documentation and help to assist both inexperienced and experienced users.
- Distributors play a crucial role in consolidating and presenting this documentation in an accessible manner.

**Important Linux Documentation Sources:**

1. **The Man Pages (Manual Pages):**
   - The "man" pages, short for "manual pages," are a fundamental source of documentation in the Linux ecosystem.
   - They provide detailed information about various commands, utilities, and system functions.
   - You can access man pages using the "man" command followed by the name of the command or topic you want to learn about. For example, `man ls` displays the manual page for the "ls" command.

2. **GNU Info:**
   - GNU Info is another documentation system that provides comprehensive information about various GNU software packages and their usage.
   - You can access GNU Info by using the "info" command followed by the name of the software or topic. For example, `info tar` displays the documentation for the "tar" utility.

3. **The Help Command and --help Option:**
   - Many Linux commands and programs support the "--help" option or have a "help" command that provides a brief summary of their usage and available options.
   - You can use this option or command to quickly get information on how to use a specific program. For example, `ls --help` provides a summary of options for the "ls" command.

4. **Other Documentation Sources:**
   - Linux distributions often provide additional documentation sources, such as handbooks, guides, and manuals tailored to their specific distribution.
   - Examples include the Gentoo Handbook, Ubuntu Documentation, and Fedora Documentation.

Accessing and utilizing these documentation sources is essential for learning how to use Linux effectively, as they provide detailed information on commands, utilities, and system functions, helping users make the most of their Linux systems.

### The man pages:

- A man page is a form of software documentation usually found on a Unix or Unix-like operating system. Topics covered include computer programs, formal standards and conventions, and even abstract concepts. A user may invoke a man page by issuing the man command.

**Man Pages (Manual Pages):**

- Man pages are the most frequently used source of documentation in the Linux ecosystem.
- They provide comprehensive documentation for a wide range of programs, utilities, configuration files, and system-related topics.
- Man pages are available on all Linux distributions and are easily accessible from the command line.
- You can access man pages by typing "man" followed by the name of the topic or command you want to learn more about. For example, `man ls` retrieves the manual page for the "ls" command.

**Historical Significance:**

- The man pages infrastructure dates back to the early versions of the UNIX operating system in the early 1970s.
- "Man" is short for "manual," reflecting its purpose of providing manual or instructional documentation.

**Conversion to Other Formats:**

- Man pages can be converted to other formats, such as PDF documents and web pages, making them accessible through various means.
- Online platforms often provide graphical interfaces for accessing man pages and other help items.

**Additional Documentation Sources:**

- In addition to man pages, Linux users can find documentation in published books and on various internet websites.
- Many online resources offer guides, tutorials, and documentation related to Linux and its various distributions.

![Screenshot from 2023-09-29 22-05-35](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/e7161c3a-2463-4554-8a63-0bc43c81e087)



Man pages serve as a fundamental resource for Linux users and administrators, offering detailed information on commands, utilities, configuration files, and system-related topics. They are an integral part of the Linux documentation ecosystem and have a rich history dating back to the early days of UNIX.

### man:

**The `man` Program:**
- `man` is a command-line program used to search, format, and display the information contained in the Linux manual pages (man pages).
- Man pages provide detailed documentation for various commands, utilities, system calls, library routines, and more.
- Since many man pages contain a substantial amount of information, the `man` program typically pipes its output through a pager program (e.g., `less`) to allow viewing one page at a time and facilitates scrolling.

**Multiple Pages for a Topic:**
- A specific topic may have multiple associated man pages, each providing different details or perspectives on the topic.
- By default, when you use the `man` command without specifying a section number or options, it displays the first available page associated with the topic.

**Listing All Pages:**
- You can use the `-f` option with `man` to list all available pages for a topic.
  - Example: `man -f topic` lists all pages related to "topic."

**Keyword Search:**
- The `-k` option with `man` allows you to perform keyword searches to find relevant man pages, even if the specified keyword is not present in the page name.
  - Example: `man -k keyword` searches for all pages discussing "keyword."

**Default Order:**
- The default order in which man pages are displayed when no section number or options are specified is determined by the configuration file `/etc/man_db.conf`.
- The order is typically organized numerically by section, but it may not precisely follow ascending numerical order.

**Equivalences:**
- `man -f` produces the same result as the `whatis` command, which provides brief descriptions of man pages.
- `man -k` is equivalent to the `apropos` command, which searches for man pages based on keywords.

The `man` command is a valuable tool for accessing detailed documentation in Linux, and its options allow you to explore and search for relevant information efficiently.

### Manual Chapters:

**Chapter Numbering:**

- Man pages are organized into chapters numbered from 1 through 9.
- Sometimes, a letter is appended to the chapter number to specify a particular topic. For example, chapter 3X often contains pages describing parts of the X Window API.
- This chapter numbering allows you to locate documentation on specific topics within the man pages.

**Using Chapter Numbers:**

- You can use the chapter number as an argument to the `man` command to force it to display a page from a particular chapter.
- This is useful when there are multiple pages with the same name across different chapters, especially for library functions or system calls.
- For example, `man 3 socket` would display the page about the `socket` function from chapter 3, which typically contains information about library functions.

**The `-a` Parameter:**

- The `-a` parameter with the `man` command allows you to display all pages with the given name across all chapters, one after the other.
- This is particularly helpful when you want to compare documentation or gather information from various chapters on a specific topic.
- For example, `man -a socket` would display all available pages related to "socket," regardless of their chapter numbers.

Using chapter numbers and the `-a` parameter enhances your ability to access and explore documentation in the Linux man pages, especially when dealing with topics covered across multiple chapters or when you want a comprehensive view of a specific subject.

### The GNU Info System:
![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/2a3de798-86c0-4726-88b7-dea94c566d0c)

- GNU stands for Gnu's Not Unix, and it is pronounced as “g-noo”. It is a recursive acronym, and it stands for “Gnu's Not Unix”. GNU is a free and open-source operating system that was started in 1984 by Richard Stallman. GNU is based on the Unix operating system, but it has been greatly modified over the years.

**GNU Info System:**

- The GNU Info System is a documentation format developed by the GNU Project.
- It is considered an alternative to traditional man pages and is the GNU Project's preferred documentation format.

**Free-Form and Linked Subsections:**

- Info pages are free-form and support linked subsections, making it possible to navigate between topics and related information easily.

**Functionality Similar to `man`:**

- In terms of functionality, Info resembles the `man` command, as it provides detailed information about various topics and commands.
- However, Info pages are connected using links, allowing for a more interconnected and structured documentation experience.

**Access Methods:**

- Information contained in Info pages can be accessed through various means, including:
  - Command-line interface
  - Graphical help utility
  - Printed documentation
  - Online viewing

**Completeness of Information:**

- Info pages are known for providing more comprehensive and detailed information compared to traditional man pages.
- When comparing the output of a simple command (e.g., `ls`), you may find that Info pages contain more extensive and in-depth content.
- While the info interface may seem to be rather outdated compared to modern help systems (even man), it often is the only easy source to get more complete information.  For example, if you compare the output on any simple command, you may find much more detail in the info page (try man ls vs info ls and count the lines, for example). Thus, it is still important to learn how to use info.

**Importance of Learning How to Use Info:**

- While the Info interface may appear somewhat outdated compared to modern help systems, it remains a valuable and often the only source for obtaining comprehensive information on specific topics.
- Learning how to use Info is important for those seeking in-depth knowledge and detailed documentation on Linux commands and topics.

The GNU Info System offers an alternative and more comprehensive way to access documentation compared to traditional man pages. Its interconnected and linked structure makes it particularly valuable for users looking for detailed information on Linux commands and topics.

### The --help Option:

- Most commands have an available short description which can be viewed using the --help or the -h option along with the command or application. For example, to learn more about the man command, you can type: 
```
$ man --help
```
The --help option is useful as a quick reference and it displays information faster than the man or info pages.

- In addition to the man pages, the GNU Info System, and the help command, there are other sources of Linux documentation, some examples of which include:

- Desktop help system
- Package documentation
- Online resources

# Processes:
## Introductuion to Process and Process Attribution:
### What is a Process:

![Screenshot from 2023-09-30 09-12-41](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/2892ca36-afe5-497d-9273-7cb3a5f741ba)

1. **Definition of a Process**: A process is an instance of one or more related tasks (threads) executing on a computer. It represents the execution of a program in action.

2. **Difference from Programs or Commands**: A process is not the same as a program or command. A single program or command can initiate multiple processes. Processes are the active, running instances of programs.

3. **Independence of Processes**: Processes can be independent of each other. They run separately and may have their own memory, resources, and execution context. The failure of one process doesn't necessarily affect others.

4. **Resource Usage**: Processes utilize system resources, including memory, CPU cycles, and peripheral devices like network cards, hard drives, printers, and displays.

5. **Operating System's Role**: The operating system, particularly the kernel, manages and allocates system resources to processes. It ensures fair resource allocation and optimized system utilization.

This information provides a clear understanding of processes in a computing context. Processes are fundamental to how modern computer systems manage and execute tasks and applications.

### Process Types:

- A terminal window (one kind of command shell) is a process that runs as long as needed. It allows users to execute programs and access resources in an interactive environment. You can also run programs in the background, which means they become detached from the shell.

Processes can be of different types according to the task being performed.


![Screenshot from 2023-09-30 09-16-48](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/d69a8317-1280-4969-887b-8632e49135cb)

### Process Scheduling and States:

1. **Scheduler Function**: The kernel's scheduler is a critical function responsible for managing processes. It allocates CPU time to processes based on their relative priority, time requirements, and the time already granted to them.

2. **Running State**: When a process is in the "running" state, it is actively executing instructions on a CPU or waiting for its turn to execute. All processes in this state are part of a "run queue," and in multi-core systems, each core has its own run queue. The term "running" can be misleading because a process might actually be swapped out, waiting for its next turn.

3. **Sleep State**: Processes may enter a "sleep" state when they are waiting for some event to occur before they can continue executing, such as waiting for user input. In this state, a process is referred to as sitting in a "wait queue."

4. **Other Process States**: There are additional, less common process states, especially during termination. For example, when a child process completes its execution but the parent process hasn't inquired about its status, the child process is in a "zombie" state. It's not active but still appears in the list of processes.
 
![Screenshot from 2023-09-30 09-22-01](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/935f75f6-9a4c-46c5-b82d-1e5f3bf38328)

This information explains the dynamic nature of processes within an operating system and how the scheduler manages their execution and states. It's essential for understanding how modern operating systems handle multitasking and resource allocation.

### Process and Thread IDs:
- At any given time, there are always multiple processes being executed. The operating system keeps track of them by assigning each a unique process ID (PID) number. The PID is used to track process state, CPU usage, memory use, precisely where resources are located in memory, and other characteristics.

- New PIDs are usually assigned in ascending order as processes are born. Thus, PID 1 denotes the init process (system initialization process), and succeeding processes are gradually assigned higher numbers.

![Screenshot from 2023-09-30 09-34-26](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/653a2ac4-1a22-48e7-97f7-4a6fdff6932b)

### Terminating a Process: 
This passage provides information on how to terminate a misbehaving or problematic application or process in a Unix-like operating system using the `kill` command:

1. **Terminate a Process**: To terminate a process, you can use the `kill` command followed by the process ID (`<pid>`) of the target process. For example, you can use the following command:

   ```
   kill -SIGKILL <pid>
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the shorthand `-9` option, which is equivalent to `SIGKILL`:

   ```
   kill -9 <pid>
   ```

   These commands forcefully terminate the specified process. The process ID (`<pid>`) uniquely identifies a running process.

2. **Limitations**: You can only terminate processes that belong to your user unless you have root (superuser) privileges. The `kill` command, despite its name, is not limited to terminating processes; it can also be used to send various types of signals to processes, including signals for purposes other than termination.

Keep in mind that forcefully terminating a process using `SIGKILL` or `-9` should be used as a last resort, as it doesn't allow the process to perform any cleanup tasks. It should be reserved for situations where a process is unresponsive or needs to be immediately terminated. In normal circumstances, you may want to use less aggressive signals (e.g., `SIGTERM`) to allow the process to shut down gracefully.

### User and Group Ids:

![Screenshot from 2023-09-30 09-54-55](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/35321edd-6601-4e61-b77a-7b894cd440ee)

1. **Real User ID (RUID)**: When a user initiates a process, the operating system assigns it a Real User ID (RUID), which identifies the user who started the process. This is used to attribute the process to a specific user.

2. **Effective User ID (EUID)**: The Effective User ID (EUID) determines the access rights for the user with respect to the process. It may or may not be the same as the RUID. The EUID is used to determine what actions a process can perform.

3. **Real Group ID (RGID)**: Groups of users can be organized into enumerated groups, and each group is identified by a Real Group ID (RGID). This ID is used to associate users with specific groups.

4. **Effective Group ID (EGID)**: The access rights of a group are determined by the Effective Group ID (EGID). It specifies which group's permissions apply to the process. A user can be a member of one or more groups, and the EGID determines the group permissions for the process.

In practice, while these details about RUID, EUID, RGID, and EGID are important for understanding and managing user and group permissions at a granular level, many discussions and commands in Unix-like systems often focus on the more commonly used User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) for simplicity.

Understanding these concepts is essential for managing file permissions, access control, and security in Unix-based operating systems, where precise control over who can do what is a fundamental part of the system's security model.

### More About Priorities:

1. **Multiple Processes**: In a Linux system (similar to most modern operating systems), many processes can be running concurrently. However, the CPU can only execute one task at a time, just as a car can have only one driver.

2. **Process Priority**: Linux allows you to set and manipulate the priority of processes. Priority determines which processes get preferential access to the CPU. Higher priority processes are scheduled to run before lower priority ones.

3. **Nice Value**: The priority of a process is set using a value called "nice value" or "niceness." The lower the nice value, the higher the priority. Processes with low nice values are considered more important and are scheduled to run sooner, while those with high nice values can wait longer for CPU time.

4. **Nice Value Range**: In Linux, the nice value ranges from -20 to +19. A nice value of -20 represents the highest priority, while +19 represents the lowest. This may seem counterintuitive because it means that the "nicer" a process is (i.e., the lower its nice value), the higher its priority.

The convention of using lower nice values for higher priority processes dates back to the early days of UNIX and has been retained for compatibility and historical reasons. It's essential for managing system resource allocation and ensuring that critical tasks are executed promptly while lower-priority tasks wait their turn.

Indeed, you can assign a "real-time priority" to tasks in a Linux system, especially for time-sensitive operations where strict timing constraints are crucial. However, it's important to understand that this "real-time priority" is different from what's referred to as "hard real-time."

1. **Real-Time Priority (Linux)**: In Linux, you can assign a real-time priority to tasks or processes that require rapid and predictable response times. This real-time priority is a higher priority level than regular processes. It's particularly useful for tasks like machine control or data collection, where immediate responses are critical. However, it's essential to note that Linux's real-time priority is not as strict as "hard real-time."

2. **Hard Real-Time**: Hard real-time systems have extremely stringent timing requirements. In a hard real-time system, tasks or processes must complete their execution within very well-defined and guaranteed time windows. Failure to meet these deadlines can have severe consequences, such as system failure or safety hazards. Hard real-time systems are typically found in critical applications like aerospace, automotive control systems, and medical devices.

In summary, while Linux provides a "real-time priority" feature that allows for high-priority task scheduling, it's not equivalent to a true "hard real-time" system. Hard real-time systems have much more stringent timing guarantees and are used in applications where timing precision is a matter of utmost importance and safety. Linux real-time priority is valuable for improving response times in time-sensitive applications but may not meet the strict demands of hard real-time systems.

## Process Metrics and Process Control:
### Load Averages: 

The concept of load average in the context of operating systems, particularly in Linux, is a measure of system workload. It's calculated as the average number of processes in one of three states over a certain period of time, typically 1, 5, or 15 minutes. The states considered are:

![Screenshot from 2023-09-30 11-18-20](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/9f98d3e0-f12a-4d96-bf7a-ffff49cf6925)
![image](https://github.com/Ankit6989/Linux/assets/114300894/5a72492a-b440-4fb5-b715-97e27defd6fd)

- The load average can be viewed by running w, top or uptime. We will explain the numbers next.

1. **Processes Actively Running on a CPU**: These are processes that are currently executing on a CPU core.

2. **Processes Considered Runnable**: These processes are in the "run queue," which means they are ready to run but are waiting for their turn to execute because the CPU is currently busy with other tasks.

3. **Sleeping Processes**: These are processes that are currently in a sleep state, often waiting for some external event or resource, such as I/O (Input/Output) operations, to become available.

It's worth noting that the way Linux calculates load average includes not only the processes in the "run queue" but also "uninterruptible sleepers." Uninterruptible sleepers are processes that cannot be easily awakened and are often waiting for I/O operations to complete. This distinction is specific to Linux and may differ from other Unix-like operating systems.

Load average provides insight into how busy a system is over time. A high load average indicates that the system has been busy and may be struggling to keep up with the demand, which could lead to performance issues. It's a valuable metric for administrators to monitor and understand system resource utilization.

### Interpreting Load Averages: 

1. **Load Average Numbers**: In a Unix-like operating system, the load average is typically displayed as three numbers, representing the system's workload over different time intervals.

    - **0.45**: This number represents the average system load over the last 1 minute. In this case, it indicates that, on average, the system was 45% utilized in the past minute.
    
    - **0.17**: This number represents the average system load over the last 5 minutes. It indicates that, on average, the system was 17% utilized in the past 5 minutes.
    
    - **0.12**: This number represents the average system load over the last 15 minutes. It indicates that, on average, the system was 12% utilized in the past 15 minutes.

2. **Interpretation for a Single-CPU System**:
   - A value of 1.00 in the second position (5-minute load average) implies that the single-CPU system was 100% utilized, on average, over the past 5 minutes. This is considered reasonable if you want to fully utilize the CPU.
   - If the 5-minute load average exceeds 1.00, it suggests that there were more processes demanding CPU time than the CPU could handle, indicating overutilization.

3. **Multiple CPUs**: If the system has more than one CPU (e.g., a quad-CPU system), you would divide the load average numbers by the number of CPUs to get a per-CPU load. For example, a 1-minute load average of 4.00 on a quad-CPU system implies that, on average, each CPU was 100% utilized during the last minute.

4. **Short-Term Increases**: Short-term increases in load average are typically not a cause for concern, as they may result from bursts of activity, such as system startup. Sustained high load averages over 5 and 15 minutes may indicate a more significant issue and warrant investigation.

Monitoring load averages is a valuable way to assess system performance and identify potential resource bottlenecks. Administering system resources based on load averages helps ensure smooth and efficient system operation.

### Background and Foreground Processes: 

1. **Foreground Jobs**: In Linux, when you run a command from a terminal, it typically runs in the foreground. When a command is in the foreground, it has control of the terminal, and other commands must wait until it completes. This is fine for quick tasks, but it can be problematic for long-running jobs.

2. **Running Jobs in the Background**: For long-running jobs, you can run them in the background. Running a job in the background means it runs at a lower priority and doesn't occupy the terminal, allowing you to continue using the terminal for other tasks. You can run a job in the background by appending an ampersand `&` to the command, like `updatedb &`.

3. **Foreground and Background Control**:
   - **CTRL-Z**: You can use `CTRL-Z` to suspend a foreground job, effectively putting it in the background. The job is stopped, and you regain control of the terminal.
   - **CTRL-C**: To terminate a foreground job, you can use `CTRL-C`. This sends a termination signal to the running job and stops it.
   - **bg Command**: You can use the `bg` command to run a suspended (background) process in the background, allowing it to continue its execution.
   - **fg Command**: The `fg` command is used to bring a background process to the foreground, allowing you to interact with it directly.

These features provide flexibility and control over how you manage and prioritize tasks in the Linux terminal, especially when dealing with long-running processes or multiple tasks simultaneously.
